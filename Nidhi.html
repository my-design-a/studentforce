                During the severe cyclonic storm, HUD HUD in the year of 2014, the North-East and Middle-East coasts were under complete depression 
                due to heavy and robust rainfall. Some cities and numerous villages were damaged severely and livelihoods of lakhs of people were disturbed. 
                TEAM VNRSF took an initiative and came forward with an idea of organizing an event NIDHI, 
                a Cyclone Relief fund to provide support to the nearby people of Visakhapatnam whose lives were severely affected by the cyclone.
                The team deliberated upon the incident and decided to organize this charity event in an unconventional manner by requesting Materialistic 
                contributions from the student and staff community to a village
                Named	TIKKAVARIPALLE	near CHIPURUPALLI	in	VISHAKAPATNAM
                District.	(Rice,  Dal,  Cereals,  Blankets,  Clothes,
                Groceries,	Brushes,	Soaps,	etc)After	a  proper survey	our	team	came	to	know	about	a	village
                named	TIKKAVARIPALLE	near
                CHIPURUPALLI in Visakhapatnam district that consisted of 150 fishermen families and was completely destroyed by the cyclone. 
                The team has then decided to extend its support to this village.
