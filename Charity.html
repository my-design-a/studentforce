                We see many people who are leading miserable lives due to lack of basic needs, we see increase
                 in child labour because of illiteracy and lack of awareness, we see children who are discontinuing.
                  we see people leaving their last breath with hunger, we see old people facing problems in their
                   last days of life and also we see them, being ignored by other sections of people.
                “VNR Student Force” here comes up with a basic Idea of collecting donations from 
                students of our college and donates it for such cases where people are in dare need of help both
                 in terms of human or financial as required. It tries to provide basic requirements rather than luxury equipment. 
                 VNRSF collects a minimum of 5/- from every student of VNR VJIET and thereby making every student part of constructing 
                 dream India. It makes worth use of each and every Rupee collected and also maintains accounts.
                  It is purely run on NON-PROFIT motive.
                VNR Student Force has not just limited in supplementing basic needs to the needy in the
                 materialistic forms by collecting money, but even it stands first in spending time with the orphans,
                  old people and the diseased by sharing love and affection by its members. With this concept,
                   VNRSF has visited and contributed to various places:
