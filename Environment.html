                IDEAL is  a novel activity that takes place in VNR VJIET which is
                organized	by	Team	VNRSF	by	involving	the
                whole	student  and	staff community with staunch
                support  from  the	Management.	It  was  launched
                in 2013 with an idea of helping the poor children
                by	donating	books	which	are	the	important
                instruments  for  their education. As a part of this
                activity,	text	books	and	knowledge-sharing
                books (novels, Dictionaries, Biographies, etc.)
                will be collected from both the students and staff
                members and are distributed  to the children who are in need.
                In addition, all the used record papers and other written papers 
                from all the labs in the college are collected and are recycled to produce new books.
                 It is a regular practice of the team in the college and till date a total of 9000 books
                were produced from 15 tonnes of waste paper which is equal to saving 150 huge trees.
                 This ideology not only meets many children’s requirements but also spread the cognizance of ‘SAVE PAPER- SAVE TREES’ 
                 and 3-R Principle.
