                        To make the Citizen Empowerment, a reality, in any nation or in any society, citizens must be ensured and preserved with their rights. In a Democratic Government, it becomes one of the basic Constitutional features for any citizen. One must even be ready with requisite knowledge when one’s rights are challenged or counter-fitted by the Government. With this broader Civic motto, on 27t h February 2017, an Interactive Session with Dr. Jaya Prakash Narayan was organized by VNR Student Force with the support of the Management of VNR VJIET.
        
        
                        The Session with title ‘A Journey for the ‘RIGHT’ Future’ was completely planned to educate the fellow students over the scope and strength of acts like ‘Right To Information’ and ‘Right To Services’. Dr. Jaya Prakash Narayan, a retired Civil Servant, a Loud-heard Whistle Blower, Founder of Organizations like ‘LokSatta Movement’ and Institutions like ‘FDR’,
        
                        being one of the drafting members of RTI Act and has been currently working on ‘Right To Services’, was chosen as the person to
                        educate and clarify the doubts.
        
        
                        Students from across the Institutions and Volunteers from various Organizations took a proactive participation in the discussion. Over those two acts, Presentations were also displayed to get a crystal level clarity to the participants. Numerous activists who are currently working for the upliftment of the Society making RTI as the weapon had
                        explained their fields and way of working. And they even elaborately mentioned the situations where, they had been facing challenges.
        
                        Dr. Jaya Prakash Narayan had delivered a key note address over the civic responsibilities of the citizens which was motivating and truly inspiring. Later,  he
                        clarified  the doubts raised by the participants and suggested the
                        best possible and smart ways to overcome the challenges faced
                        by the  activists  to fulfil their dreams by furnishing	their objectives.
                        As a whole, this brain-storming session had served as an excellent
                        source for exhibiting Ground  level reality of the  system  and  one’s
                        duty to demand their Rights  by fulfilling one’s Fundamental  Duties

                India, the world’s biggest of youth, producing millions of engineers every year and with the 40% of working age population has the great advantage of demographic dividend. Demographic dividend will be a nightmare without the intervention of youth so, youth plays a major role in the development of the nation and demographic dividend.
                Team VNR STUDENT FORCE with an intention of conveying the importance of role of youth in the development of nation conducted a talk by V.V. Laxmi Narayana IPS on the topic “The Role of Youth in Fostering the Development of India” on 7th April 2018. The talk began with addressing the advantage of demographic dividend to India where the average age of India’s youth will be 29 years by 2025. Youth can be referred as the one who can make a change by their though process rather then age. “జ్వలించే గుండెలు, స్పందించే స్వభావం కలవారే యువత”. Eminent people like Chanakya who established the university, Goutham Buddha, Adi Shankaracharya who unified the people of different religions, Shivaji & Bala Gangadhara Tilak who struggled for the Independence are referred to as best examples for youth which suits the quote that youth is the one who have “జ్వలించే గుండెలు, స్పందించే స్వభావం కలవారే యువత”.

            Laxmi Narasimha who left a well-paid job and started working for his village called YAZALI where he is establishing a Farmers Producing Organisation which works for the betterment of agricultural field stood as the inspiration for the present youth. Youth do not have the right to criticise; Youth only have the right to find solutions are the inspiring lines quoted by V.V. Laxmi Narayana sir.
            Having the wish and will to serve the nation and desire to work for the development of nation, what youth can do? The role of students is well addressed by V.V. Laxmi Narayana. The 4 important attributes i.e., Character, Culture, Attitude and Behaviour, and Thought Process are the important attributes which are essential for youth and these can contribute for their all-round development. Youth should keep adding values to their lives and lead a respectable life with the due respect towards their parents and teachers. Reading books always help for the youth of an individual, the life stories of eminent personalities, epics, Mythology, Writings of Poets transform youth into better citizens. Some of the books “Stray Birds by Rabindranath Tagore, You are Unique by A.P.J Abdul Kalam, Autobiographies of B.R. Ambedkar, A.P.J Abdul Kalam(Wings of Wire)”  are  suggested by him.


            13
            Youth who have the ability to travel against the flow and the courage to fight for the change can bring the change. Youth must strive for Centre of Excellence, an Auto driver in Mumbai who strives for Centre of Excellence arranged Newspapers, chocol-sm mt-2 mb-2ates for children, free telephone, drinking water and a WIFI router in his auto making it a better vehicle to travel. He also serves the people by charging only 50% for senior citizens and free journey for patients or disabled, this inspired the individuals to serve the people in some or the other way.

            An individual can become a better person by imbibing the qualities of service, courage& strength and by striving for Centre of Excellence. One can imbibe these qualities by training the body, training the mind(stability in thoughts), training the words spoken and by training thought process youth can contribute to the development of this nation with due responsibility by being responsive to the things that go around and getting educated and also educating others both morally and intellectually.

            Questions by a student in interactive session
            Later the talk continued with the interactive session with the participants. One of the question was “How youth can stand with their goals and avoid deviating from the good path?” An anecdote of Gurukul students from Mahabharata, in which the apatite to learn new things and their respect for their gurus protected a student from Akaalamruthyu was well portrayed to make the students understand how one should not deviate from their paths and stand with their goals till they achieved their goals. “For achieving demographic dividend education plays an important role-but there is a problem of dropouts at each and every stage till secondary education-How these dropouts can be reduced?” was another question related to topic in the interactive session. This was well addressed quoting the examples of work done by NGOs towards education like Teach For India etc., The message of all round development of individual and their role as a citizen was well conveyed through the talk. Talk ended by singing National Anthem.

                Apne Raksha’ is one of such Awareness related Practical workshops over the Precautions to be taken against Calamities and Hazards as well as the First-Aid procedure to be applied over a victim. This workshop was handled by Dr. Vinay Kumar, an RMP by profession. The need for the awareness on the aspects of first-aid was conferred with the turnover of the people to the workshop.

                Since the First-Aid procedure varies from hazard to hazard or victim to victim, he explained the methods of approach to apply First-Aid for various kinds of victims like:
                <ul>
                    <li>Persons bitten by Snakes and Scorpions</li>

                The students were initially observed that, they were not perfect enough in basics of Mathematics and languages like Telugu and English. So with an intention to equip the students with the basic concepts, ABHYAAS has taken up the basic Arithmetic Operations to be taught to the students for certain timeline. Although, they were taught not only academics, but also moral values were taught, and efforts were kept to enhance their Analytical and

                Reasoning skills. Career guidance to students is also a part of our program.

                To build character, moral values and also to create interest on the subject, every session has been included an inspirational story and an activity. To improve the children’s General Knowledge and also to get them updated with the current issues they are frequently encountered with the questions related to the current affairs. With an intention to make a habit of reading newspaper, newspaper cutting was given as homework to the children in every session. Also to improve their writing skills, children are being encouraged to write their daily routine in English. And thorough checking on their works was done in every session.

                Objective of Project ABHYAAS is not only confined to making the children equipped with knowledge by imparting the true essence of education but also to enhance the teaching skills with daily progress among the team members
